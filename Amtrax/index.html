          <h3>HR Support</h3>
          <p>
            HR TOOLKIT To make sure you meet current legislation and good
            practice, we offer a comprehensive toolkit which can be used for all
            areas of the business. From forms to formal letters, your toolkit
            will give you the documents you need to operate effectively,
            reducing admin time and ensuring consistency. Our toolkit is not
            just about ticking boxes as we use our expertise to develop the
            right processes which will benefit your organisation as a whole. HR
            HEALTH CHECK For your business to be successful, it is vitally
            important that your HR processes and ways of working are up to date
            and in line with current legislation and best practice. We offer a
            comprehensive HR Health Check to assess your current approach. We
            spend time at your office and carry out an audit of your processes
            and ways of working. We will produce a report which identifies any
            areas of concern and makes recommendations, and we will put an
            action plan in place to ensure your HR is in the best possible
            health. FLEXIBLE HR We can tailor our services to suit all types and
            sizes of businesses. Whether you need an HR Director, adviser or
            administrator, we offer a broad range of packages from
            online/telephone support to a fully integrated service as an
            extension of your team. All services can be offered on a project
            basis, as and when the need is required, or on a monthly retained
            basis – whichever works best for you. So, whatever HR outsourcing
            service you are seeking, we can tailor a bespoke solution to meet
            your requirements. <br /><strong

          <h3>Resourcing & Talent Planning</h3>
          <> Through our specialist resourcing and talent planning service
          stream, we deliver recruitment outsourcing solutions for employers and
          organisations of all sizes throughout the UK. Over the last two
          decades, we’ve seen technology disrupt the recruitment industry.
          Candidates now have more control over their job searches than ever
          before. Job seekers want to know about an employer’s values and brand
          before they consider applying for a role.
          <p>
            If you’re finding it difficult to recruit for key roles in your
            business, it may be time to review what you’ve been doing and
            consider if that needs to change. Each time you now recruit for a
            role, you should be treating that as a new project, and commencing a
            targeted campaign for that job vacancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the job advert, to media placement, to candidate outreach, each
            element of your recruitment process needs to be tailored to the
            candidates you’re seeking to attract.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide a full recruitment outsourcing service, which means we
            can work with you from start to finish on the recruitment of one, or
            all your job vacancies. Some of our clients outsource all their
            recruitment to Amtrax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, you can outsource just one, or a few, aspects of your
            recruitment. For example, we can draft and place your job adverts
            for you, or design and run your recruitment assessment centres.

          <h3>Organisation Development</h3>
          <p>
            Our team of experienced HR and OD consultants can partner with you to deliver sustained improvement and change as your business grows and evolves
          </p>
          <p>Organisation development is about improving the effectiveness of your business through your people.  It’s based on the principle that many elements of an organisation are interlinked and therefore a holistic, and wider approach, can identify the real issues and enable lasting change.</p>
          <p>The skill of organisational development (OD) is identifying the key factors (i.e. what to rule out, what to include), influencing productivity and making key (often quite small) changes to fine tune systems, processes and the way that our people work together. This enables us to deliver sustained improvement as our organisations continue to grow and evolve</p>
          <p>Our team of experienced HR and organisation development consultants will partner with you to help you build and maintain a sustainable organisation</p>
          <p>So, whether you’re dealing with a current HR issue, or you’re keen to proactively explore how best to support your organisation’s productivity in the future, organisation development solutions can unlock hidden obstacles, and provide clarity on what’s important.</p>

          <h3>Pay & Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            Whether you’re a start-up business needing salary benchmarking before you recruit your first employee, or a larger organisation requiring a full review of your total reward package, our specialist HR consultants can help.
          </p>
          <p>Pay and benefits is now about so much more than salary. Employees care more about their total reward package including: flexible working, family friendly benefits, cycle to work scheme, pensions and life assurance, salary sacrifice schemes, employee wellbeing and annual leave</p>
          <p>Creating a clear strategy around pay and benefits supports your wider HR and organisational goals including recruitment and retention, culture, well-being and productivity.</p>
          <p>We can partner with you to develop your employee benefits strategy through focus groups and surveys in addition to our local and sector knowledge.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, you may be seeking support on a specific aspect of your pay and benefits activities, such as employee communications, benchmarking, or gender pay gap reporting. Through our range of employee pay and benefits consultancy services, we can provide you with the solution you’re seeking.</p>

            <h3>Business Improvement</h3>
            <h5>Strategic HR</h5>
            <p>We know your people are central to driving your business forward, so it makes sense to plan ahead to make sure you have the right knowledge, skills and commitment in place to achieve your business goals</p>
            <p>Amtrax can support you with Strategic HR Management, developing a strategic framework which focuses on achieving long-term business goals and outcomes. We consider people issues and matching resources to future needs, as well as issues such as structure, quality, culture, values and commitment to take your business to the next level</p>

            <h5>Project Managemen</h5>
            <p>With any change or improvement projects, it is important they are planned, prioritised, tracked and completed.</p>
            <p>We have extensive project management experience and expertise, using a trusted process to ensure a clear and consistent approach to delivery. Working as the project lead or part of the team, we help identify goals, milestones and measurements; develop a methodical approach to delivering your objectives; and provide essential accountability support to ensure the project stays on track</p>

            <h4>Employee Survey</h4>
            <p>Employee engagement is a significant driver for organisational success. How you measure this depends on a number of factors, but a good quality staff survey will give you valuable insights. It is proven that employees are more likely to complete a survey than raise a concern at a meeting – so it can uncover issues at an earlier stage and allow you to take swifter action.</p>
            <p>Amtrax has developed an effective Employee Survey, which is easy to distribute and complete. We offer expert evaluation, using the results to make recommendations which feed into the strategic objectives of the organisation.</p>
